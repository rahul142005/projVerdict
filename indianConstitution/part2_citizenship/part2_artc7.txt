A person who moved from India to what is now Pakistan after March 1, 1947, will not be considered a citizen of India.

However:

If someone moved to Pakistan but later returned to India with a special permit for resettlement or permanent return, they will be treated as if they moved to India after July 19, 1948, for the purposes of Article 6.
