Even if a person does not meet the criteria in Article 5, they will be considered a citizen of India if:

They, their parents, or their grandparents were born in India (as defined by the Government of India Act, 1935), and
They are living in another country but have been registered as an Indian citizen by an Indian embassy or consulate in that country.
The registration can be done by applying to the Indian diplomatic or consular representative, either before or after the Constitution started, following the rules set by the Government of India.
