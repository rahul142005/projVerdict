When a person is arrested, they must be told why they are being arrested as soon as possible. They also have the right to talk to and be defended by a lawyer of their choice.

An arrested person must be taken to a magistrate within 24 hours of their arrest (excluding travel time). They cannot be held longer than 24 hours without a magistrateâ€™s approval.

These rules do not apply to:

(a) Enemy aliens (people from countries at war with India).
(b) People detained under laws for preventive detention (detention to prevent future crimes).
Preventive detention laws cannot keep a person in custody for more than three months unless:

(a) An Advisory Board (composed of people qualified to be High Court Judges) has reviewed and approved the detention before the three months are up.
(b) The detention follows laws made by Parliament.
If someone is detained under preventive detention laws, they must be told the reasons for their detention and be given a chance to challenge it.

The authority can withhold information if revealing it is against public interest.

Parliament can make laws about:

(a) Conditions and cases where a person can be detained for more than three months without Advisory Board approval.
(b) The maximum period for detention in different cases.
(c) The procedures for how the Advisory Board reviews these cases.
