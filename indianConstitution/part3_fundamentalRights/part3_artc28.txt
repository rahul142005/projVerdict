No religious teaching will be given in schools or colleges that are fully funded by the government.

This rule doesn't apply to government schools that are set up by a trust or endowment that requires religious teaching.

Students in government-recognized or funded schools cannot be forced to participate in religious instruction or worship. They must give their own consent, or if they are minors, their guardian must consent.
