Laws aimed at achieving the goals outlined in the Directive Principles of State Policy (Part IV) cannot be challenged in court for violating fundamental rights under Article 14 (equality) or Article 19 (freedoms). These laws cannot be questioned based on their effectiveness in achieving the stated policy objectives. However, if such a law is made by a State Legislature, it must be approved by the President to benefit from this protection.
