Parliament (the law-making body) can:

(a) Create a new state by taking land from an existing state, combining two or more states, or adding new territory to any state.
(b) Make a state larger by adding more land.
(c) Make a state smaller by taking away some land.
(d) Change the borders of a state.
(e) Change the name of a state.
However:

No changes can be proposed unless the President first agrees.
If the proposed change affects the area, borders, or name of a state, the President must ask that stateâ€™s legislature for its opinion. This opinion must be given within the time specified by the President.
Explanations:

When we talk about a "State" in this article, it includes Union territories, but the special rules apply only to regular states.
The power to create new states or Union territories includes combining parts of existing states or Union territories.
