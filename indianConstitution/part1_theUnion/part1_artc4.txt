Any law made under Article 2 or Article 3 to create, change, or adjust states must also update the First Schedule and Fourth Schedule of the Constitution as needed. The law may include additional details about how to handle representation in Parliament and state legislatures.

Such a law is not considered a change to the Constitution for the purposes of Article 368 (which deals with constitutional amendments).
